To be honest, I haven't tried drawing anything much at all for like the last month or so. But I'll have to make art for archangels eventually, so we'll see how that goes. The only piece I made that I liked so far was... <br>Hold on.. let me summon the courage to show you.. <br><img src=\"images/other/innocence.png\" style=\"width: 220px; margin: 15px 0;\"> <br>In case you can't tell, its a white-haired girl with a halo and a tail. <br>I'm not showing you anything else. It's embarrassing.",
