Just gotta drop this <code>.jar</code> into my project aaand.. its not working. <br><br>alright fine, I'll take the time to learn to properly configure my project classpath. Ah, so thats how it works! So I just have to set these options and...and of course it's still not working. <br><br>You know what? I heard build tools are great for managing projects and their dependencies. If I can't figure it out, maybe maven can save me.<br><br>Alright. Everything is finally in place. It took me a while to get familiar with maven, but now I finally have a properly organized maven project.<br><br>I should be good to finally run the program and--<br><br>What do you mean \"this package isn't recognized\"!? The <code>.jar</code> file is right there!! What did I mess up now...<br><br>..Oh. I had to <code>require</code> the necessary modules in the <code>module-info.java</code> file. Wait a second, whats a module?
